# Accidents Data Analysis - United States
This is a Python-based analysis of the "US Accidents" dataset to understand and visualize trends, such as the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents, the influence of environmental factors on accident rates, and the locations where accidents are most likely to occur. The goal is to identify ways to reduce the frequency of accidents.
