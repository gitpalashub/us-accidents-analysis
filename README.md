# Accidents Data Analysis - United States
This is a Python-based analysis of the "US Accidents" dataset to understand and visualize trends, such as the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents, the influence of environmental factors on accident rates, and the locations where accidents are most likely to occur. The goal is to identify ways to reduce the frequency of accidents.

### About the US-Accidents Dataset
The US-Accidents dataset is a collection of traffic accident data covering 49 states in the United States. The data is continuously collected from February 2016 using several data providers, including two APIs that provide streaming traffic event data. These APIs transmit information about traffic events that have been recorded by various organizations, such as state and national departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road network. As of 2021, the dataset includes approximately 3 million updated records of traffic accidents.

The US-Accidents dataset was gathered in real-time using multiple traffic APIs. It currently contains accident data from February 2016 to December 2020 for the contiguous United States. For more information about this dataset, you can visit [this website](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents)

There are many potential applications for the US-Accidents dataset, such as predicting traffic accidents in real-time, identifying hotspots for traffic accidents, analyzing the causes and effects of accidents, and studying the impact of environmental factors on accident rates.
